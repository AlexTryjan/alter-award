  \section*{Our Past Year of Recruitment}
    The Beta Nu chapter has had a successful year of recruitment. Six candidates were initiated in Spring 2015 under Marshal Peyton Turner, with 1 candidate slated to be initiated early next semester due to grades. The one candidate who has not been initiated is working closely with our scholarship chair and is confident he will meet our standards. Seven candidates were initiated Fall 2014 under Marshal Aditya Rengaswamy. Since initiation, the Fall 2014 class has given great amounts towards chapter involvement; two members were elected First and Second Guards; one was elected Secretary; one Historian, and yet another was appointed to the position of Membership Development Chair. We expect great things out of both candidate classes in the near future. Our chapter size is 38-45 (depending on how you classify co-ops), which is slightly above average at CWRU and very healthy for Beta Nu of Theta Chi. We will continue to have enough people to maintain an affective chapter.
    
  \section*{Recruitment Workshops, Culture, and Values}
    Recruitment workshops are held once a semester by the Recruitment Committee, and these workshops highlight the recruitment values of OX. Highlights of the workshop include discussions on how prospective members approach Greek life in general, as well as the pressures they may face to join Greek Life or not. Beta Nu strives to create comfortable and approachable environments during recruitment. These workshops help us to better interact with prospective members. \\

    Our chapter held two recruitment workshops over the past academic year. The Fall 2014 workshop consisted of an informal ``Dating Guide to Recruitment'' presentation, given by a brother of Delta Chi - Marquez Brown. Among the highlights of the presentation were the ``10/80/10 Principle``, in which nearly 80\% of college men have ''never put any thought`` into joining a Greek organization, while 10\% are determined to join and 10\% never will. As such, our chapter has refocused our recruitment efforts towards the 80\% who are undecided, instead of just those who will most likely join. Events like OX Talks and the Resolute Man Scholarship are programs that focus on those 80\%. Additionally, Mr. Brown discussed a ''Names List for Potential Members``, which our chapter now keeps in a chapter-public Google Drive. The ''Dating Guide to Recruitment'' presentation is included in this application. \\

    At the Spring 2015 Retreat, our chapter held a discussion on the stages potential new members progress through in deciding whether to join Greek Life – specifically, our chapter. We also discussed our brothers' personal stories in small groups of how we were recruited into the fraternity to get a better understanding of how recruitment actually works. ``People join people'', or the notion that an organization's members are the drawing force for the group, was a major topic that came up when we discussed in our small groups. We also talked about our values and reinforced the idea that we are looking for brothers who care about our values. We want man who support those in need. An image from our Spring 2015 recruitment discussion is attached in the appendices as a sample of what we discussed. 
    
  \section*{The Traditional Recruitment Process}
    At Case Western Reserve, the Greek community spends the first two weeks of each semester recruiting new members. As such, Beta Nu's Recruitment Committee spends the previous semester preparing a rush calendar of events as drafted by the Recruitment Chair. During preparation, the committee discusses the values that our chapter looks for in candidates through a recruitment workshop and meetings. Traditionally, the committee has met once every two weeks. In detail, each Rush event is individually chaired by a captain and lieutenant, and volunteers are chosen for each event. In addition to longstanding popular events, such as OX Arcade and Havana Night, we added and modified events, such as OX Talks.
    
  \section*{OX Talks}
    While enjoying a meal prepared by our house chef, brothers and advisors stand and give presentations on the chapter’s achievements and values; among such achievements were our own alumnus advisor Brother Drushel’s research advancements as well as Brother Rengaswamy’s organizational efforts with founding Kids Against Hunger. The event also awards \$1000 to an unaffiliated male that best exemplifies a commitment to make a difference in their communities. This scholarship winner is decided through an interview and application process that is completed a week before the event. Many of our current brothers have won this notable annual scholarship. 
    
  \section*{365 Recruitment}
    365 recruitment events encourage year-round recruitment; one of the most popular event is Artemis 365 – a 6 player spaceship simulator that encourages conversation and provides an opportunity for non-affiliated men to plan and interact with brothers. Another 365 recruitment event we are hosting this semester is Theta Chi improv. During this event brothers will bring their acting and comedic talents to the center stage. We make an effort to invite potential new members on our names list to all 365 recruitment events.
    
  \section*{Recruitment Goals}
    Over the next two semesters we want to recruit a total of 20 people. As of Fall 2014-Spring 2015, our identity embodies a culture of caring for others and making an impact. This identity will serve as well in recruiting quality men who will strive to better our campus. We will always recruit with the mentality of becoming a better chapter. Though we have accomplished a lot these last few semesters, more than we have in recent chapter history, it is not a time for us to be complacent. Recruitment is our lifeblood, and that is something we will continue to work towards improving.
