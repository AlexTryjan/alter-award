# alter-award

This repository holds the 2015 and 2016 Beta Nu Chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity's applications to the Howard R. Alter Junior Award for Chapter Excellence.

Included are the .tex files used to generate the final .pdf application, so it will be easily updateable. 

If you are a future Awards Chair for the chapter and don't know how to use latex, ask another brother for help, or email ramon@case.edu.
