# alter-award

This is the Beta Nu Chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity's application to the 2015 Howard R. Alter Junior Award for Chapter Excellence. Written by Secretary Alec Frye, President Aditya Rengaswamy, and Awards Chair Zack Williams.

Included are the latex files used to produce the application. Ideally, future award chairs will be able to fork this over and easily edit their documents while maintaining the look that latex-ing gives you. Additionally, much of the content can be largely pasted into future applications with minimal adjustment. This project will be successful if it actually aids in organizational memory.
