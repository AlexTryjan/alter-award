\chapter{Community Service and Philanthropy Programming}

  \section*{A Look At The Numbers}
    The brothers of Beta Nu engage in a broad variety of community service endeavors. In the past year, we have completed 546 hours of officially documented service, a remarkable  59.6\% increase from the 342 where we were last year, and a 76.1\% increase from the 310 the year before. This puts us at 55\% of our service goal for the year, which when you add at least another 150 or so hours being processed, puts us on track to reach 1000 by the end of the semester. We are also already at 205\% of our philanthropy goal of \$1000, with more still to be processed. We are proud of this progress.

      During each chapter meeting, our Service Chair lists a few community service opportunities available to brothers, giving them an ability to hear what they can participate in and contribute to. This has helped the chapter raise the number of hours we have reached by so much.

      We have brothers who, this past year...
      
      \begin{enumerate}
      	
      	\item Lead marches on various issues, specifically those on the environment.
      	
      	\item Ran a week long camp serving children whose parents have cancer
      	
      	\item Helped create a survey on mental health at CWRU to reach the entire student body that will lead to mental health policy reforms in the CWRU administration
      	
      	\item Lead service workshops for Replay for Kids for all CWRU students.
      	
      	\item Lead a week long campaign on Mental Health (See Sacred Purpose).
      \end{enumerate}
      
      We take pride in what our brothers continue to accomplish all over this University and beyond its borders. This is but a sample of the impact we have made on our community - an embodiment of 'the Assisting Hand'.
